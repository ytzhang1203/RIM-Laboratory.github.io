### Georgios Asimomitis
{:.left}

Georgios Asimomitis is a data-driven Computational Biologist in Elli Papaemmanuil’s lab. He specializes in the design and implementation of computational frameworks for integrating multiple data modalities and his research interests focus on the application of AI and machine learning in cell and molecular data in the context of disease understanding, diagnosis and treatment. He is currently engaged in the joint analysis of RNAseq and ATACseq data in MDS as well as to the development of machine learning models for single-cell data.

Throughout his path, Georgios has built a strong set of technical and data mining skills. He received his undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens in 2015 and his Master of Science in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics from ETH Zurich in 2018. Before joining Elli’s lab, he was a member of IBM Research in Zurich working on the intersection of deep learning and genome architecture as part of his Master Thesis.
