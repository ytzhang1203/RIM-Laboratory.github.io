### Joseph G. McCarter

Joseph graduated with a PhD from the Department of Biochemistry at National University of Ireland, Galway. Under the supervision of Prof. Kevin F. Sullivan, he worked on elucidating centromeric chromatin composition through ChIPseq analysis of centromere proteins. He then went on to work as a post-doctoral scientist with Prof. Brian McStay.

Joseph’s postdoctoral work involved the use of long-read sequencing to perform de novo assembly of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) regions, located in the five human acrocentric chromosomes. These regions are now incorporated in the GRC38p13 human genome assembly.

Currently, Joseph is a senior computational biologist in the Papaemmanuil lab. He is working closely with the Department of Pediatrics testing and developing analytical methodologies to support their precision medicine program.
